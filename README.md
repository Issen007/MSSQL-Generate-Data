# MSSQL Generate Data
This is a very small and simple application that write and read data to a Microsoft SQL Server.
This is only to test and see if it works.

## Prerequirment
You most install following packages on your machine.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And you most create manually a database and a tablespace that you have Read/Write access to.


## Run the software
Easiest way to run it just run following command
`python mssql.py -D TestDB -T ReadOnly -u 'USERNAME' -p 'PASSWORD' -wr -g`
